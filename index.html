                The capybara, sometimes referred to by its scientific name of <em>Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris</em>, is
                the largest rodent on Earth. It primarily lives in South America, but can be found in zoos all over
                the world. It is closely related to guinea pigs, which is easier to see in younger capybaras. It is
                a highly social animal, and can be found in groups as large as 100. Though, groups of up to 10
                are more common.

                <p>
                    The name <em>capybara</em> is derived from the Tupi word <em>ka'api√ªara</em>. Tupi is a now
                    extinct language which was used by the Tupi people living in Brazil. Translated, this word means
                    'one who
                    eats slender leaves' or 'grass-eater'.<br>Its scientific name, <em>Hydrochoerus
                        hydrochaeris</em>, is derived from the Greek words <em>hydro</em> meaning 'water' and
                    <em>choiros</em> meaning 'pig'. So one could also call them 'water pigs'. This is what the German
                    language does, as the Germans call the capybara <em>Wasserschwein</em>, meaning 'water swine'.

                    Capybaras inhabit diverse ecosystems across South America, where they have adapted to both land and
                    water environments. The charismatic creatures are most commonly found in wetlands, such as marshes,
                    swamps, and along the banks of rivers, lakes, and ponds.
                    <br><br>
                    Their ideal habitat consists of abundant vegetation, including grasses, aquatic plants, and shrubs,
                    which provide them with food and cover. Capybaras are herbivores and graze on a variety of plants,
                    including grasses, reeds, and aquatic vegetation. They have specialized digestive systems that allow
                    them to efficiently extract nutrients from tough and fibrous plant material.

                    Water is a vital component of their habitat as capybaras are semi-aquatic animals. They are
                    excellent swimmers and spend a significant amount of time in the water, where they find refuge from
                    predators, regulate their body temperature, and search for food. They have partially webbed feet,
                    which aid in swimming and navigating through aquatic environments.
                    <br><br>
                    Capybaras are social animals and often live in small groups known as troops or herds. These groups
                    can consist of several individuals, ranging from a few individuals to over 100. The troops establish
                    territories that include both land and water areas, ensuring access to food and suitable breeding
                    sites.
                    <br><br>
                    Their habitat also supports a diverse array of other wildlife. Capybaras play a crucial role in the
                    ecosystem as a food source for predators, such as jaguars, caimans, and anacondas. Additionally,
                    their grazing behavior helps maintain the balance of vegetation and supports a healthy wetland
                    ecosystem.

                    Capybaras are herbivores with a diverse and adaptable diet. Their primary food sources include
                    grasses, aquatic plants, and shrubs. They graze on a variety of vegetation, both on land and in
                    water, to fulfill their dietary needs.

                    Capybaras are known to be selective grazers, carefully choosing the most nutritious parts of plants.
                    They use their sharp incisors to crop grasses close to the ground, maximizing their foraging
                    efficiency. Their digestive systems are specialized for breaking down tough and fibrous plant
                    material, allowing them to extract as many nutrients as possible from their vegetarian diet.
                    <br><br>
                    This herbivorous diet not only sustains capybaras but also has significant ecological implications.
                    Capybaras contribute to seed dispersal by consuming fruits and vegetation, aiding in the
                    regeneration of plant species and maintaining the biodiversity of their habitats. Furthermore, their
                    grazing behavior can influence the structure and composition of plant communities, shaping
                    vegetation dynamics in their environment.

            <p>
                One of the primary dangers capybaras face is habitat loss. As human populations expand and urban areas
                sprawl, their natural habitats, which include marshes, swamps, and grassy plains near bodies of water,
                are being destroyed or fragmented. Deforestation, agriculture, and infrastructure development result in
                the loss of vital feeding and breeding grounds for capybaras, pushing them into smaller and isolated
                areas. This habitat loss leads to increased competition for resources, limited genetic diversity, and
                reduced overall population numbers.
                <br><br>
                Additionally, capybaras face the threats of hunting and poaching. In some regions, they are hunted for
                their meat and skin. Their meat is considered a delicacy in some South American countries, and their
                hides are used for various purposes. Although hunting them is often illegal, it still persists in
                certain areas, contributing to a decline in capybara populations. Efforts to enforce regulations and
                promote sustainable practices are crucial for their protection.
